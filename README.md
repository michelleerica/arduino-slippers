# Milo learns hardware

This is a passion project and my first hardware project.

I wanted to learn about hardware so I'm teaching myself (with a lot of assistance from others) with the Arduino Bluno Beetle and a passion project involving sensors and an accelerometer on a ballet slipper.

I've starting writing about my project [here](https://medium.com/two-half-glasses/adventures-in-hardware-part-1-baby-steps-b76e3d570c63)
